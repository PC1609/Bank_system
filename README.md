Bank account management system : using Java, JDBC and MySQL database 
<br><br>
The project allows user to register with Signup classes, generating a card number and pin which can be used in an ATM simulated environment to deposit, withdraw cash from bank account, change pin or access a mini transaction statement. Java connects to MySQL database using JDBC's Connection and statement classes to fetch and update relevant user data.
